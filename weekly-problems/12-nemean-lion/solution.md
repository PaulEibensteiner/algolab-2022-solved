# Solution

## Basic Idea

$a_3$ is the easiest one: Just go through all the faces of the delaunay triangulation and count the ones with the minimum squared radius. For the other outpus, we have to consider the edges of the delaunay triangulation, because they are the only point pairs in the graph, through which a circle can pass without touching other points. For each edge, to make things easier to reason about, it makes sense to consider that the center of the circle in question actually can only move in a right angle to the edge in question, starting from the edge's center. Plus the circle's radius is grows with the distance of the center to the edge. Now we calculate the maximum and minimum circle's squared radius for each edge: The maximum is actually easy: Just the max of the squared radius of the circumcircles of the adjacent triangles (if one is infinite then make infinity work somehow). The min is a little trickier: Usually it is just half the edge length squared. But if one of the adjacent triangles is obtuse, you have to take it's circumcircle's squared radius as the minimum. Finally if you have min and max for every edge, using it for a_2 (counting mins), a_s (counting min <= s <= max)  and a_max (sliding window) is quite straight forward.
