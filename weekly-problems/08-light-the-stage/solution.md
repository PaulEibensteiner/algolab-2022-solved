# Solution

## Basic Idea

The first group of test sets is easy: Create a Delaunay triangulation of the lamps $O(n \log n)$. Then for each participant, find the closest lamp $O(m\log n)$ and if it is closer than the lamp radius plus the personâ€™s radius, remove the person from the winning set. For the remaining test sets just performing the search for each partial set of lamps is too expensive $O(n m \log n)$. But we can binary search for the amount of lamps needed to remove all participants, and then output the people removed in the run with one lamp less.
