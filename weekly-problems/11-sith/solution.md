# Solution

You need the maximum cardinality connected component with edge length $\leq r$, where the minimum index of points in the component is larger than or equal to the component's cardinality. 

This can be done by adding the points to a delaunay triangulation, starting at the largest index. When adding a point, unite it's component with all the components 'in range', and update the result with the minimum between component size and added index (since it is guaranteed to be the smallest).

Or you do binary search on connected components in graph with points n-i, where if the maximum size component is bigger than i, you decrease i, and else you increase i.
