# algolab-2022-solved

Personal repository for solved problems in the course Algorithms Lab at ETHZ in autumn semester 2022. C++ code Style is Google's, the target is to have a problem description and solution in markdown for every problem for better understanding and preparation for the exam.

The recommended installed version for running the code in this repository are: C++14 (gcc 8.3.1), BGL version 1.55 or newer, CGAL version 4.6 or newer, CMAKE version 3.2 or newer. On Linux install with `sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev libcgal-dev cmake cmake-data`

To correctly display the problem statements either typora, mathpix, pandoc or a similar program is required. Alternatively, just read them in plain text if you're comfortable with latex math. I hate pdf so I am not going to upload any pdf problem descriptions here.
